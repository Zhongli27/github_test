        1. Inception of Wi-Fi Technology:
       </p></strong>
     <ul>
       <li>The IEEE 802.11 standard, developed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), was first introduced in 1997.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          It aimed to create a standardized method for wireless communication, replacing the need for physical cables.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          The IEEE 802.11 standard was created to address the growing need for wireless communication in various applications, including offices, homes, and public spaces.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          It aimed to establish a set of protocols that would enable devices to communicate wirelessly and seamlessly.
        </li>
      </ul>

     <p style="text-align:left"><strong>2. Wireless Communication and its Evolution:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
          IEEE 802.11 has evolved through several amendments and versions.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            Prominent iterations include 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n, 802.11ac, and 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6), each introducing improved performance, speed, and range.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            802.11b was the first widely adopted standard, providing a data rate of 11 Mbps.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            802.11g followed, offering higher speeds (54 Mbps) and operating in the 2.4 GHz band.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            802.11n introduced multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology, boosting speeds and range.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            802.11ac brought gigabit speeds and 5 GHz operation, reducing interference.
          </li>
        </ul>

         <strong><p style="text-align:left;">3. Frequency Bands and Data Rates:</p></strong>
         <ul>
           <li>
             Wi-Fi operates in both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands.
           </li>
           <br>
           <li>
             Different versions offer varying data transfer rates, with the latest, Wi-Fi 6, providing multi-gigabit speeds.
           </li>
           <br>
           <li>
             The 2.4 GHz band provides broader coverage but is often crowded due to many devices using it.
           </li>
           <br>
           <li>
             The 5 GHz band offers faster data rates and is less congested.
           </li>
           <br>
           <li>
             Wi-Fi 6 can achieve speeds up to 9.6 Gbps, making it suitable for applications like 4K video streaming and virtual reality.

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    IEEE 802.11 supports various modes, including infrastructure mode for connecting to access points and ad-hoc mode for peer-to-peer connections.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                      Infrastructure mode is the most common, where devices connect to a central access point.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                      Ad-hoc mode allows devices to connect directly without a central access point, useful for peer-to-peer file sharing.

                         <br>
                         <li>
                           Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) was the first security protocol, but it had serious vulnerabilities.
                         </li>
                         <br>

                           Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) and WPA2 were introduced to enhance security.
                         </li>
                         <br>
                         <li>
                           WPA3, the latest iteration, further strengthens security with improved encryption methods.
